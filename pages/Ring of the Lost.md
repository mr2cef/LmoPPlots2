	- This artifact appears to be a simple, unremarkable iron ring, covered in rust and wear. However, it once belonged to a powerful Lich who used it as a focus for necromantic rituals. The ring's former owner imbued it with dark magic, leaving a faint trace of their essence behind. Though the Lich is long gone, the ring still calls out to the dead, attracting undead creatures who sense its lingering power.
	- Undead are inexplicably drawn to the ring, seeing it as a symbol of authority or a source of necromantic energy. When worn, the ring subtly pulls nearby undead toward the wearer, making it harder for them to avoid detection. Additionally, it grants the wearer limited protection from weaker undead, who may mistake them for an ally. However, more powerful undead may be lured by the ringâ€™s potential to enhance their own dark magic, making it a dangerous tool to possess.
