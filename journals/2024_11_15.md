	- ### Skill Challenge: "Escape to the Forest"  
	  **Objective**: 8 successes before 3 failures. The green dragon chases the group through the abandoned village, but the cultists, undead, and plant monsters add to the chaos. The group must navigate these dangers to reach the safety of the forest.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 1. **Cultists’ Ambush**  
	  Some surviving cultists, enraged by their leader’s death, block a key route out of the village. They are desperate and dangerous, willing to sacrifice everything to hinder the group.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 2. **Vine Trap**  
	  A patch of the village is covered in thick, animated vines from the plant monsters. The vines lash out, attempting to ensnare anything that moves.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 3. **Rising Undead**  
	  As the group moves through a graveyard, skeletal hands claw their way up from the ground. The undead rise en masse, threatening to surround and overwhelm the group.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 4. **Dragon’s Roar**  
	  The dragon unleashes a bone-shaking roar that causes the ground to tremble and nearby structures to crumble, testing the group’s ability to stay focused and move quickly.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 5. **Cultist’s Ritual**  
	  A group of cultists is performing a desperate ritual in a ruined temple, summoning more undead to slow the dragon. However, the ritual unleashes chaotic energy that disrupts the environment, threatening the group’s escape.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 6. **Plant Monster Ambush**  
	  A massive plant creature, blending into the overgrown ruins, suddenly lurches out, attempting to block the group’s path with its writhing, thorny limbs.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 7. **Fog of Decay**  
	  A cloud of necrotic mist spreads through the streets, emanating from the remains of undead and cultist rituals. The thick fog obscures vision and saps strength, making navigation nearly impossible.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 8. **Forest’s Threshold**  
	  Just as the group nears the forest, a combination of undead, cultists, and plant monsters converge, creating a final gauntlet they must break through with the dragon closing in from above.
